I donâ€™t think much as changed about my opinion on data scientists and what they do. I still think it is like a bridge between computer science, statistics, and a subject matter expert. I think my thoughts on R are the same too. I like the flexibility of it and being able to use packages created by others, but sometimes the errors are not very helpful and there is no universal webpage to troubleshoot problems and find solutions. I will continue to use R in the future, because I think it is a great tool and seemingly more universal that SAS. Now that I have some practice doing things a different way I think going forward I will use a mix of old practices and new ones. I have tried to get better about using comments so that way someone new looking at my code can figure out what I was doing. I think I will try to create more of my own functions and using APIs to pull data from various online sources.
