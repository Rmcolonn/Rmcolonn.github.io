I think this course is going well so far. I have at times been frustrated, becasue sometimes with R you can have an error and be unable to figure out what is wrong and it could be something simple or more complex, but you don't really know which one. I like the format of the class and the lectures paired with a homework assignment. I am not a fan of how the due dates changes in the middle, things used to be due T/Th, but then they changed to M/Th which seemed strange. This class overall has been good, it has tested my prior knowledge of R and forced me to rethink about some of the ways I code, and I have learned some new very valuable skills.
