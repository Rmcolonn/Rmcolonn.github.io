title: Project 2 Post
---

For this project, I was tasked to do some analysis on online news populatirty. My first task in completing this project was to create a RMarkdown file and sync it to my GitHub account in its own [repository](https://github.com/Rmcolonn/Projest-2) . If I were to do this project differently I would probably would've spent more time doing some backgroun research on the data and imporant predictors. I would also try to look and see what other research was done in order to try and produce the best model I can. The most difficult part for me was getting the parameter aspect to work. It kept saying that params was not defined even though it was and when I ran each chunk individually with it the it worked. I finally was able to get it to work after I updated the `knitr` package. My big takeaways from this project is that sometimes you just need to go back to the beginning and reinstall packages and make sure that everything is up to date.
