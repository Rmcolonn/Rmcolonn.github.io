I have had experience with R and SAS, and I prefer to use R. I like how it is open source and so I don’t have to worry about accessing it through the VTL. Another great feature of R is being able to use packages other people have created. I have often found myself working on projects and searching for how to do the specific thing in R and have more often than not found a package that has a function to do what I am trying to do. On the other hand, one thing I miss about SAS is having access to their online help page and reading through the documentation to learn more about a function. I have been able to use other websites to find answers when I am running into issues, but sometimes those aren’t helpful. I would consider the R basics and even some of the packages, like tidyverse, easy to learn. I have used R for almost 3 years in classes and on some projects and I thought that I had a pretty good grasp on how to use it and have knowledge about lots of different functions and packages, but I will say I have struggled with some of these homework’s. I think sometimes I get used to doing things my way and now having to follow the instructions and using functions in a new way and creating more of my own functions I do think that it can get pretty complicated. I also think that if you are willing to stick with it and take a break when you get frustrated, you can figure out the issue and solve the problem.
