I am currently enrolled in the Accelerated Bachelors/Masters program for Statistics at NC State. I Graduated from undergrad on May 9th, and am now officially a Masters student. During my undergraduate career at NC State I worked with the NC State baseball and tennis teams. I'm planning to continue to help out on those projects, but take more of a advisor role since I will be graduating soon. 

### More Information

Some of my hobbies include working out, spending time with my friends/family, watching sporting events (baseball is my favorite), and traveling.
